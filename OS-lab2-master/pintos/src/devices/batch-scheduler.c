/*
 * Exercise on thread synchronization.
 *
 * Assume a half-duplex communication bus with limited capacity, measured in
 * tasks, and 2 priority levels:
 *
 * - tasks: A task signifies a unit of data communication over the bus
 *
 * - half-duplex: All tasks using the bus should have the same direction
 *
 * - limited capacity: There can be only 3 tasks using the bus at the same time.
 *                     In other words, the bus has only 3 slots.
 *
 *  - 2 priority levels: Priority tasks take precedence over non-priority tasks
 *
 *  Fill-in your code after the TODO comments
